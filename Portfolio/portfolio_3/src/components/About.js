      I am new to software engineering, but not new to technology. I started with networking and learnt a lot about data movement and management. I adore technology, which drove me to a 6-month intense software engineering degree. There, I developed my programming skills, learned how to develop software, and became more adept at working together on projects.
      I'm excited to apply what I've learned in a real-world setting, joining a team to assist solve difficult challenges and make things operate more smoothly. I want to continue improving at what I do and support a company that likes to try new things and develop.

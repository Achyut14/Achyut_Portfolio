#////While Loops
# num =0
# while num <= 100:
#     print(num)
#     num = num + 10

# print("All Done")


# Another Example

# target = 33
# guess  = None
# while guess != target:
#     guess = input("Please enter a guess...")
#     if guess =='q' or guess =='quit':
#         break
#     guess = int(guess)
# print("All Done")



#///For Loops

# colors = ['red', 'orange', 'blue', 'green']
# for color in colors:
#     print(color)

# Another Exmaple
# for char in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ":
#     print(char)
